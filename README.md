Code to calculate the best March Madness bracket.

Guidelines:

1.  The end of the tournament is what it's all about. For example take a look at the ESPN 2024 celeb competition: https://fantasy.espn.com/games/tournament-challenge-bracket-2024/. 31 picked UConn, 47 picked someone else. The worst bracket with UConn as the winner beat the best bracket with a different winner.
2.  Think of the early rounds are a tiebreaker. If you get the same result on the winner (and runnerup) as someone else, the early rounds can and will make the difference.
3.  Pick the best teams. The goal is to get the most points possible, and the best way to do that is to avoid underdogs almost entirely. Picking all favorites is often one of the strongest possible brackets.
4.  Exception to the above: there's a big advantage to picking a strong winner nobody else has. If you know who other people are picking to win then try to avoid those picks. As the bracket grows the value of picking underrated winners late in the tournament can become large enough to overcome #3.
5.  There's a huge amount of randomness in the tournament! That's what makes it so fun after all. Picking the best bracket may give you a 2% chance of winning your bracket instead of 1% so make sure to have fun as well.
